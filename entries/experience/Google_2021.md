description: "I worked with Display Ads SRE for a 4-month SRE Internship. During this internship, I created an interface for producers and consumers of data to interact, and support for new consumers and producers that wanted instant access to any of the existing data & services using the interface. This allowed N x M systems to interact with N + M complexity."
