> UCC Works is a professional skills development programme, and demonstrates that students (undergraduate and postgraduate) have engaged in, and developed transferable skills through extra-curricular activities, work experience, civic engagement and global awareness. The purpose of UCC Works is to give students valuable work-based and work-related experience and enhance the development of broader competencies and to receive formal recognition from University College Cork for the learning acquired from same. This UCC programme supports students in their professional and personal development whilst at the same time encouraging them to actively support and participate in the UCC community and beyond to become global citizens.
