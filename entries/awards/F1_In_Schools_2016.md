description: "During my transition year I created a Formula 1 in schoolsâ€™ team. I recruited 5 other friends for the team. It was the first time our school ever competed, and we were the only non-technical school competing. Over the course of the year we gained sponsorship, designed and manufactured a 20:1 scale F1 car. We won 2 awards at the Regional's (Best Website, Best Presentation) and at the National Finals we won three awards (Best presentation, Best Marketing and Best Newcomer)."
