description: "I won the Fidelity Investments Final Year Project Prize for my final year project [PlugNexus.com](https://plugnexus.com). The following is feedback from Fidelity on why they chose PlugNexus:

> 'This is a fantastic example of taking a real life business problem and applying technology to solve. Itâ€™s a very current problem and I particularly liked the way Aidan approached his analysis of the problem to quickly identify that scaling charging stations is not going to resolve the issue. Aidans solution is scalable and he has also ensured the application is responsive for mobile users who would be a large portion of the user base.' - Fidelity"
