description: "
  Throughout 2013 - 2015 I completed cycles 1 and 2 of the Munster Programming Training program, hosted in University College Cork. The MPT Cycle 1 program aims to offer to transition year students a special training in computer programming as preparation for participation in the *All Irish Schools Programming Competition*. The MPT Cycle 2 program enrols the best MPT Cycle 1 students for 1 or 2 more years for a special training in algorithms and problem solving as preparation for the national and international programming competitions.
